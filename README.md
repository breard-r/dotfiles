# dotfiles

This is just a bunch of dotfiles.

## Emacs
You should install the following modes:

* python-mode (community/emacs-python-mode)
* lua-mode (community/emacs-lua-mode)
* php-mode (community/emacs-php-mode)
* markdown-mode (aur/emacs-markdown-mode)

## Awesome
The wallpaper is randomly set from images (png, jpg and jpeg) from `~/pictures/wallpapers/enabled/`. You should populate this directory with symbolic links pointing to images stored in `~/pictures/wallpapers/`.
